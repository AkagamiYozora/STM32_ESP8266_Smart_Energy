The combination of STM32 and ESP8266 to monitor electrical energy used by house system.

Moreover, it could also detect back-ward current flow on neutral wire so that admin will be noticed if there was an exceptional current flowing through the system. As an IoT based project, this system also connected to Telegram using wifi on ESP8266 as its base for easy control and monitor using smartphone. The component used on this project is :
1. STM32 F103C8T6
2. ESP8266
3. PZEM-004t
4. ACS712 (5A)
5. LCD 16x2
6. I2C
7. MicroSD Module
8. GPS Neo 6M-V2

Documentation will be updated along with this project.
